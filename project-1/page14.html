        The secret ingredient in McDonald's chicken nuggets, or McNuggets, is
        found to be <b>Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)!</b> In 2016, Mcdonald's removed
        TBHQ from their chicken nuggets in attempt to make their food
        "healthier." While TBHQ is removed from the ingredients list, it is not
        quite removed from the nuggets because
        <b>TBHQ is still in their cooking oil.</b> This can be very dangerous as
        TBHQ is a man-made antioxidant that is used to preserve foods that
        contain fats, but it's also used in cosmetics, paints, and varnishes.
