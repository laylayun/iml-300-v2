[Build Your Abmient Sound](https://editor.p5js.org/laylayun/sketches/kcZ6sHeG_) is an interactive experience where user can create a personal sanctuary on the web through mixing ambient sounds.

### Description

Whenever I am under a lot of pressure, I like to play calming everyday sounds in order to destress. While I enjoyed the everyday sounds I could find on YouTube, I soon wanted to build my own mixture of sounds that I could listen to. Therefore, I decided to build that platform myself.

Users can mix and match their favorite sounds by clicking on different objects they can find in the artowrk. I created a background arts that interacts with the sound and changes as users click a certain object in order to enhance the mood and the interactive experience.

You can play and stop the sound by clicking on the object! Explore around to see which objects will make sounds, and have fun!
